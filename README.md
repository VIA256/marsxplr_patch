== MARSXPLR PATCH ==

   This is a single python file, which --when placed in your mars explorer game directory and run  with python 3 (on windows version of marxplr)-- re-enables easy access to the old sleugh of whirlds that you know and love.

   But wait, theres more! This patch also re-enables the amazing managed multiplayer feature, which means you can now create and join worlds without having to worry about port forwarding.

   In addition to these essential features, the patch also raises the maximum number of bots spawnable in a session --from 10-- to 255
